## Usage

You can specify your desired dot size and dot spacing, as well as the output page size, in the bottom line of the script.

All measurements are in metric millimeter (mm) format. Example output uses 1.1mm dots with 2.5mm spacing, and A4 (210mm x 297mm) page size.

While the PNG script is useful for fast previewing, I suggest using the PDF one for your final printout. Be sure to choose the "Actual size" option under the scaling section of your print options dialog, so that the size of the dots and spacing matches up exactly with the values you specify.
