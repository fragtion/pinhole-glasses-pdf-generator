DIY Pinhole Glasses Template Generator

So basically all this does is generate a template for the improvised "lenses" to be cut out from. The dot sizes and spacing can be customized.
You will need your own frames, of course, and your own way of boring the holes. I used a small drill-bit. Others prefer a safety pin heated up with a lighter. You could probably also find a copper wire of suitable thickness and attach that to a conventional solering iron

The bulk of this code was generated using OpenAI's ChatGPT, following my instructions of course

## Usage

You can specify your desired dot size and dot spacing, as well as the output page size, in the bottom line of the script.

All measurements are in metric millimeter (mm) format. Example output uses 1.1mm dots with 2.5mm spacing, and A4 (210mm x 297mm) page size.

While the PNG script is useful for fast previewing, I suggest using the PDF one for your final printout. Be sure to choose the "Actual size" option under the scaling section of your print options dialog, so that the size of the dots and spacing matches up exactly with the values you specify.
